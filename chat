04.06.2015 14:22 I pushed the test_sandbox directory, where I copied the structure of the pyinterpolation folder of last week. In the markovanalysis/implementation.py i put all the useful functions (towersample, kosuraju, various counts) and I tried to write a first version of a "getSationaryDistribution" function. But it doesn't work. I also wrote a test for the getStationaryDistribution function. but it doesnt work [giulio]
