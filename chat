21:05:2015 15:53 Project started. Have fun :) [Nils]
28.05.2015 15:21 Checkin' in again. Nothing much to do yet. [giulio]
02.06.2015 16:30 I will work out the class concept now and try to push it by night [Nils]
04.06.2015 14:22 I pushed the test_sandbox directory, where I copied the structure of the pyinterpolation folder of last week. In the markovanalysis/implementation.py i put all the useful functions (towersample, kosuraju, various counts) and I tried to write a first version of a "getSationaryDistribution" function. But it doesn't work. I also wrote a test for the getStationaryDistribution function. but it doesnt work [giulio]
18.06.2015 12:35 Finished the Log-Class and optimized the analysis container-class. I will start to include the separate functions now. [Nils]
18.06.2015 13:57 I finished writing the k_means algrithm, now it works, for any dataset of any dimention. I'll start writing some plotting tools and tests. Sorry I can't make it to class today [giulio]

Hi Nils, it's giulio here, this chat thing didn't work in the end. I need to talk to you, can you write me at my email address? giuliorasi@gmail.com
I think we need to postpone the presentation, there is no way we can finish even one module before next friday. There are some deep things missing from our implementation:

-the 1 diminutional example should expose some sort of double well potential energy behavior, but it's still all pretty random to me.

UDPATE #2

sorry guys,, it's giulio again i'm not sure when i can come today, I'm waiting fro a very important package at home, I was assured it would have arrived in the morning. It's 11:27 now, I'll come by car as soon as it arrives. 
if you have any problem call me at 015777813588

Decided on multi-thread solution instead of numba
